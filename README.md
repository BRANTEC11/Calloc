# Calloc

Calloc (Cassette Allocator) is designed to conveniently list tracks in a playlist and allocate
those tracks in an optimized order to neatly fit them in each side of a cassette tape given the specific length per
side. This program allows the user to: add in tracks, allocate tracks automatically or manually, swap tracks,
remove one or all tracks, rename a track, change the length of a track, change the length of the cassette, and
import and export their playlist to be saved for future use.
